# GPGA
"General Purpose Genetic Algorithm" library using neural networks

This is just a library I made to help myself create evolution simulators more quickly without having to rewrite code over and over again.
The library allows you to train a population of neural networks to achieve some behavior through my custom genetic algorithm, involving
crossovers, mutations, and tournament selections. 

Example code is provided.
